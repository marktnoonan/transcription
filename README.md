# Live Transcript 

A small application to use computer speech to text to show translation online and live. This makes sense for scenarios such as hearing impaired or recording something to be more machine readable.

NOTE: This requires the Chrome browser for the speaker. It uses a built in feature in Chrome for text to speech. 

# Prerequisites

1. node.js
2. git
3. parcel.js
4. Chrome browser

# Getting started
```javascript

git clone https://github.com/marktnoonan/transcription.git

npm install --global parcel

parcel index.html

point your Chrome browser to localhost:1234

```

This should get you up and running. Please report failures/problems with the build process.
